"""How do I access a module written in Python from C?"""
# Answer:

# Understanding how Python works is a given for any Python developer. However, thereâ€™s no point in trying to get a word-for-word answer. Instead, look out for personal stories on how candidates have used specific features. 

# You can get a pointer to the module object as follows:

# module = PyImport_ImportModule("");
