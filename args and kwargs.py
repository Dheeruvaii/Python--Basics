# Now we can use both *args ,**kwargs
# to pass arguments to this function :
myFun('geeks', 'for', 'geeks', first="Geeks", mid="for", last="Geeks")

# defining car class

	# args receives unlimited no. of arguments as an array
	def __init__(self, **kwargs):
		# access args index like array does
		self.speed = kwargs['s']

# creating objects of car class
audi = car(s=200, c='red')

# printing the color and speed of cars

"""How do I access a module written in Python from C?"""
# Answer:

# Understanding how Python works is a given for any Python developer. However, thereâ€™s no point in trying to get a word-for-word answer. Instead, look out for personal stories on how candidates have used specific features. 

# You can get a pointer to the module object as follows:

# module = PyImport_ImportModule("");
